# iemhacks_Elite-Devs

Problem Statement: A candidate feel unconfident or maybe he/she can't speak fluent english, It maybe the cause of them a rejection in an interview's HR round. So they join coaching or others, but still they feel nervous or shy to communicate publically. We have seen this problem among many student, they also scared by thinking opponent one will judge them, So we have thought of building an AI model based environment where they can communicate with HR model and practice their pre-interview process freely. 

Project Installation SetUp: For front-end we have used html, js and tailwind css. For the back-end we have used node.js and express.js. For API token we will be using OpenAI API. For communication via NPL, we have used DialogFlow and google assistance API key.
